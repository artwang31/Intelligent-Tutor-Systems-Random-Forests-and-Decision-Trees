# Intelligent-Tutor-Systems-Random-Forests-and-Decision-Trees

For this assignment we will be using data from the Assistments Intelligent Tutoring system. 
https://new.assistments.org/

The Intelligent Tutoring System gives students hints based on how they perform on math problems. 

I wanted to see if I could build a decision tree to help teachers decide which students to follow up with, 
based on students' performance in Assistments. 

I created three groups 
1. teacher should intervene
2. teacher should monitor student progress
3. teacher should take "no action" 

based on students' previous use of the system and how many hints they used. 

To do this we will I built a decision tree using the "party" package. 
The party package builds decision trees based on a set of statistical stopping rules.
